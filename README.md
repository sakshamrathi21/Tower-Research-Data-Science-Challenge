# Tower Research Data Science Challenge

This repository contains solutions to the **Game of Trust Challenge**, inspired by the classic *Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma*. It was conducted by Tower Research Limestone. The challenge comprises six problems, focusing on strategy analysis, modeling, and optimization under noisy conditions. 

## Challenge Overview

In this two-player game, participants choose between **TRUST** and **CHEAT** actions across multiple rounds, with outcomes influenced by fixed (but unknown) strategies. Players aim to analyze the strategies, group participants based on behavior, and develop a superior strategy to outperform others in a Monte Carlo simulation environment.

## Problems Solved

1. **Small World**  
   Identifying the number of distinct strategies employed by players based on prior game actions and outcomes.

2. **Birds of a Feather**  
   Partitioning players into groups based on shared strategies, ordered and sorted by player IDs.

3. **Now I See You**  
   Reverse engineering strategies through machine learning, predicting actions, and interpreting the results.

4. **Pecking Order**  
   Simulating all strategies against one another in an environment with no noise, ranking them based on performance.

5. **Dark Forest**  
   Introducing miscommunication probabilities and examining changes in strategy rankings under various noise conditions.

6. **Master of All**  
   Designing a custom strategy aimed at outperforming existing ones, leveraging insights from prior problems.
